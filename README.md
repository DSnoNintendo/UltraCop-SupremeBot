# Ultra Cop
Web automation bot programmed in Python to purchase items from Supreme clothing website, where popular items sell out in seconds (~80% success rate)

# What I learned
Web Automation (Selenium webdriver)

HTML Scraping (urllib, BeautifulSoup)

Threading

UI Design (Tkinter)

# How to use
Every Thursday, Supreme releases new pieces on their website. Every Wednesday night, you can see the items releasing on https://www.reddit.com/r/supremeclothing/. Find the item you want (for demo purposes, you can choose an item on the Supreme website [https://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/all] that hasn't sold out and enter nonsense credit card information), enter the keywords into the keyword box, choose the category, color etc.. Enter your information and start the bot. Once the autofill has been set up, you can start the bot. If you are trying to get an item that is releasing on Thursday, your best bet is to start the bot at 07:59:45 PST because items release at 8:00:00 PST. For demo purposes, you can start it at any time. After that, just sit back and enjoy the show.

# APP IS NOW DEFUNCT
This was a 2017 project that is now defunct due to Supreme contantly updating their website to fight bots. This was a personal project that I started as a learning experience and no longer have time to work on, but I am leaving my code up for educational purposes
